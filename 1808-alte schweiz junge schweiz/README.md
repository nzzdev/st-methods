# 1808-alte schweiz junge schweiz

1. This script uses data on the median age in Swiss municipalities at different points in time (1970, 1980, 1990, 2000, 2010 and 2016) to examine and visualise the age development per municipality, over time, using graphics and maps.

2. Results based on this script were published in the following article:
  * [Die Romandie altert weniger stark als die Deutschschweiz](https://nzz.ch/ld.1351100)
  * Published 20.06.2018
  * The article shows that German-speaking Swiss municipalities aged more than French-speaking ones, in general, that this effect is stronger in certain types of municipalities, and it explains where this difference comes from.

3. The dataset of median age per municipality and year (1970, 1980, 1990, 2000, 2010 and 2016) was processed for NZZ Storytelling by the [Swiss Federal Statistical Office](https://www.bfs.admin.ch/bfs/en/home.html), and municipality categories were taken from the [Federal Statistical Office](https://www.bfs.admin.ch/bfs/de/home/statistiken/querschnittsthemen/raeumliche-analysen/raeumliche-gliederungen.html), too. Part of our interpretation of ageing patterns is based on migration saldos per canton. This data was taken from the [Swiss State Secretariat for Migration](https://www.sem.admin.ch/sem/de/home/publiservice/statistik/auslaenderstatistik/archiv.html).

4. The script uses the median age of Swiss municipalities for the years 1970, 1980, 1990, 2000, 2010 and 2016 to map age per year and municipality as well as age development between 1970 and 2016, per municipality. Furthermore, the script calculates age development and population growth for each municipality between 2016 and 1970 and plots these variables against each other. It also explores these variables for different types of municipalities, calculates whether the differences found are statistically significant and processes additional data in order to interpret the findings.
