# Correlation between Covid vaccination rates and incidence 

This R script provides the calculations used in this article [this article](https://www.nzz.ch/schweiz/corona-in-der-schweiz-je-mehr-impfungen-desto-weniger-faelle-ld.1646731) on the correlation between covid vaccination rates and infections in swiss cantons and Zurich zip codes. It also includes some robustness checks.

Script loads new data, but cuts off dates after publication (2021-09-23 and after). Because of incomplete data for the last few days  that will complete with time, some figures might be slightly different from the published ones.
