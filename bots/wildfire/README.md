# Wildfire Automation

This automation downloads data from [FIRMS, the Fire Information for Resource Management System](https://firms.modaps.eosdis.nasa.gov) by Nasa.

Based on the [Q map](https://medium.com/nzz-open/lets-build-together-nzz-s-storytelling-toolbox-q-is-now-open-source-39decb92aeca) that should be updated, the data will be cropped, prepared and uploaded back to the map.

## Tools needed

This tool uses [Yarn 2](https://yarnpkg.com) for package management. It's set up to use Plug'n'Play for fast script execution.
