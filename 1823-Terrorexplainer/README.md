1. These scripts uses data from the Global Terrorism Database (GTD) for the years 1970 to 2018 and data from an own categorization of terror groups. They are used to determine what is the difference between islamistic terror groups and other.

2. Results based on this script were published in the following article:

	Tödlicher, brutaler, amateurhafter: Wieso islamistische Anschläge mehr Opfer fordern als jede andere Form von Terror
[Published 07.03.2019](https://www.nzz.ch/visuals/doppelt-so-viele-opfer-sieben-mal-so-viele-selbstmordanschlaege-wie-der-islamistische-terror-eine-neue-brutalitaet-in-die-welt-brachte-ld.1440333)

	The article shows that islamistic terror is deadlier than other forms of terror because of it is methods and its targets.

3. The raw dataset can be pulled from [GTD](https://www.start.umd.edu/gtd/). The classification and the sources are in the file "TerrorGroups_Over100Deaths_2017_2.csv"

4. We only included groups that are classified by at least two sources. Also, to cross-check we calculated the group/non-group comparisons against our "islamist-group" against the entire rest of the database without any major differences.
